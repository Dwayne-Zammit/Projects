## icemalta_competition

**Description:** This project was used in the CodeSprint 2023 Malta competition, where I proudly secured a position in the top 10. The web app, built using Flask API, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, provides a unique functionality to launch a lab. The lab created an EC2 instance in AWS, retrieves the instance's IP, username, and password, and generates a .rdp file for the user. You can find the results and the task booklet on the official [CodeSprint Malta 2023 website](https://codesprintmalta.edu.mt/code-spint-2023/).
