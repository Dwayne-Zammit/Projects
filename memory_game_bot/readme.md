This is a script that was also erquested from my friend to beat a memory game by google.

Basically this game asks you to remember a color. Every new level the number of colors increments by one, so if one is level 200 it asks you to remember 200 steps and one must click on 200 steps.


I have basically created a script(all code is mine, no bits were copied. I basically scan for a change in 4 specific pixels on the monitor. 
if this pixel changes I add the color to a list which I then later use to foreloop in and click on the colors.) 


P.S I left this running for around 20 hrs and I was level 350, so this basically is able to run forever!
