This code was used in a competition that I participated in 2023 (CodeSprint Malta)
One had to go the a physical class room and spend 8 hrs coding and this is what I achieved.
I placed top 10 (which is a very good result for me as I am not a full stack engineer but a DevOps engineer and this shows that I really understand the dev part):
