This script was requested by my friend as a challenge to draw a perfect circle in a game: https://neal.fun/perfect-circle/


This is also a script I created without any help online etc, where I tried to discover the formula needed in order to draw the perfect circle.
I used cos and sin, this surely remind me of my secondary school days. 
I remember that I used to subconciously think "why do we learn this stuff :)?"


PS this best works on 1920x1080p res (score 99.9%) but I also made an equation to make it work on different resolutions.
